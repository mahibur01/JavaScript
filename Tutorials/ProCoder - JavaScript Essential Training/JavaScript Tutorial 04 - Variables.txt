JavaScript Tutorial 04 - Variables

1. There are 3 ways to declare a JavaScript variable:

    1.1 var
    Example: 
        var x = 5;
        var y = 6;
        var z = x + y;

    1.2 let
    Example: 
        let x = "John Doe";
        let x = 0;
        // SyntaxError: 'x' has already been declared

    1.3 const
    Example: 
        const PI = 3.141592653589793;
        PI = 3.14;      // This will give an error
        PI = PI + 10;   // This will also give an error

2. Tips 

    2.1 Stanadard is use let for var 
    2.2 Variable and identifier let x = 50; here x is identifier and 50 is value 
    2.3 identifier should be meaningful and camelCase
    2.4 const variable used for unchanged value
